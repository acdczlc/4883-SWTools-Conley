I chose the Mac app, Preview, for my software tool. Preview falls into the categories of image editing and 
documentation. Preview is a lightweight tool that comes installed on mac computers by default. Preview can
be used in quite a few ways but I typically use it to view PDFs, and quickly edit images. I have also used
preview to combine multiple PDFs together quickly. I chose to write about Preview, because I think it is a 
tool that many people use all the time, but never put much thought into. Many people likely don't even
realize that they use Preview. Preview is the default app to view PDFs on a mac, so, many people who are 
viewing PDFs accidentally launch the app just by clicking on a PDF, and don't even realize what they did.
Preview allows users to make small edits to pictures and write on them. Preview is exclusive to MacOS and 
is included with all Macs for free.
